SQL ANALYSIS: EDA + DATA ANALYSIS + RECOMMENDATIONS

SELECT *  
From Spotify_Youtube ;


**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**

-- Check the number of unique apps in the dataset

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID) 
from Spotify_Youtube ;

-- Check for any missing values in key fields

SELECT count(*) 
From Spotify_Youtube 
WHERE ID IS NULL or Stream is NULL or Views is NULL ;

--Find out the number of albums per artist

SELECT count(Album) as NumAlbums, Artist 
from Spotify_Youtube 
group by Artist 
order by NumAlbums DESC  ;

--Find out the number of singles per artist

SELECT count(*) as NumAlbums, Artist 
from Spotify_Youtube
WHERE Album_type = 'single'
group by Artist 
order by NumAlbums desc ;

-- Get an overview of Album's Energy levels

SELECT min(Energy), max(energy), avg(Energy)
From Spotify_Youtube ;

-- Determine whether there are more total views or streams recorded  

SELECT COUNT(views) as NumViews, COUNT(stream) as NumStreams
from Spotify_Youtube ;

--How're they distributed?

**DATA ANALYSIS**

-- Determine whether singles have higher durations then album tracks


SELECT (SELECT AVG(Duration_ms) as AvgDurAlbTr
FROM Spotify_Youtube 
WHERE Album_type = 'album'), AVG(Duration_ms) as AvgDurSing
From Spotify_Youtube 
WHERE Album_type = 'single';

-- Determine which Artists have the loudest music

SELECT artist, AVG(Loudness) as AvgLoud
from Spotify_Youtube 
group by Artist 
ORDER by AvgLoud DESC  
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if tracks with high Danceability have higher streams 

SELECT CASE 
			WHEN Danceability > '0.66' then 'High Danceability'
			WHEN Danceability  BETWEEN '0.33' AND '0.66' then 'Mid Danceability'
			WHEN Danceability < '0.33' then 'Low Danceability'
		END AS DanceabilityRating, AVG(Stream) as AvgStream
FROM Spotify_Youtube 	
group by DanceabilityRating
ORDER by AvgStream DESC 
		;
	
-- -- Check if tracks with high Energy have higher Views
	
	SELECT CASE 
			WHEN Energy  > '0.66' then 'High Energy'
			WHEN Energy  BETWEEN '0.33' AND '0.66' then 'Mid Energy'
			WHEN Energy  < '0.33' then 'Low Energy'
		END AS EnergyRating, AVG(Views) as AvgViews
FROM Spotify_Youtube 	
group by EnergyRating
ORDER by AvgViews DESC 
		;
	
-- Check Artists with most acousticness
	
SELECT Artist, AVG(Acousticness) as AvgAcousticness
from Spotify_Youtube
group by Artist  
ORDER by AvgAcousticness Desc;

**RECOMMENDATIONS/INSIGHTS**

1. Singles are shorter in duration than Album tracks on average 
2. Longer tracks by duration perform better on spotify than YouTube & Shorter tracks perform better on YouTube
3. By this logic, singles perform better on YouTube than Spotify.
4. Danceability is positively correlated with Streams
5. Energy is positively correlated with Views
